# VenturaSQL
The 3-tier SQL framework for C# projects.

VenturaSQL is an integrated system with three parts:

+ A small NuGet package [VenturaSQL.NETStandard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VenturaSQL.NETStandard) for the runtime
+ A tiny package [VenturaSQL.AspNetCore.Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VenturaSQL.AspNetCore.Server) to process incoming requests in the ASP.NET Core middle-tier
+ The VenturaSQLStudio WPF app that connects to your database and generates recordset source code for both client and server C# projects.

Install VenturaSQL Studio by downloading the the installer. The installer comes with ready to run sample projects.

Online documentation: https://docs.sysdev.nl

The installer will be available early May. The online documentation is for version 3, and needs updating to version 4.
