# The 3-tier SQL framework for C# projects
VenturaSQL is an integrated system that uses web API to get your database data to any client running C# code. It is highly recommended for building **rich browser-based apps** with **Blazor WebAssembly**.

[Here is a demo](https://blazordemo.com) of a Blazor WebAssembly app using VenturaSQL for data access.

- Easy to configure.
- Really, really fast.
- One simple Web API controller that only needs to be set up once.
- There is no API to define. Enter SQL statements in the editor and click Generate.
- Recordsets with modification tracking on the client.
- Data is packed and transmitted over Http in binary format.

Where an ORM binds to columns properties dynamically, VenturaSQL is static and the mapping is already done at compile time. With a runtime DLL of less than 100KB you can keep using the ORM solution and add VenturaSQL to your project.

VenturaSQL can use any ADO.NET data provider, but currently the only tested providers are:
+ System.Data.SqlClient (Microsoft SQL Server)
+ System.Data.SQLite (SQLite.org)
+ PostgreSQL (Npgsql)

## The VenturaSQL system
VenturaSQL has three parts:

+ The small NuGet package [VenturaSQL.NETStandard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VenturaSQL.NETStandard) for the client runtime.
+ The tiny NuGet package [VenturaSQL.AspNetCore.Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VenturaSQL.AspNetCore.Server) to process incoming requests in the ASP.NET Core middle-tier.
+ The VenturaSQLStudio WPF app that connects to your database and generates recordset source code for both client and server C# projects.

The runtime DLL is 95KB, and the middle-tier DLL is 13KB. VenturaSQL is lightweight, does not use reflection and is very fast.

## VenturaSQL Studio
The VenturaSQL Studio WPF app generates recordset classes based on SQL statements you enter in the editor. The generated recordsets are automatically injected into server and client C# projects. Recordsets are generated by clicking a button. When a SQL statement is changed, simply click the Generate button again.

Basic recordsets with SQL statements for retrieving rows by primary key(s) are automatically created.

## Web API
A single static Web API controller with a POST method needs to be added to the ASP.NET Core project.

```csharp
    [ApiController]
    public class VenturaSqlController : ControllerBase
    {
        [Route("api/venturasql")]
        [HttpPost]
        public Task Index(byte[] requestData)
        {
            var processor = new VenturaSqlServerEngine();
            processor.RequestData = requestData;
            processor.CallBacks.LookupAdoConnector = LookupAdoConnector;
            processor.Exec();
            return Response.Body.WriteAsync(processor.ResponseBuffer, 0, processor.ResponseLength);
        }

        private AdoConnector LookupAdoConnector(string requestedName)
        {
            return new AdoConnector(SqlClientFactory.Instance, "Server=tcp:xxx,1433;Initial Catalog=VanArsdel;User ID=yyy;Password=zzz;");
        }
```
## Client code
The VenturaSQL C# recordsets running in the browser are optimized for speed and have built in change tracking. Only modified data is transmitted back to the server.

```csharp
VenturaSqlConfig.DefaultConnector = new HttpConnector("DefaultConnector", "api/venturasql");

PriKey_CountryCodes_Recordset rs = new PriKey_CountryCodes_Recordset();

rs.ExecSql("us");

if (rs.RecordCount != 0)
{
    MessageBox.Show($"Country code 'us' already exists.");
    return;
}

rs.Append();
rs.CountryCodeID = "us";
rs.Name = "United States";

rs.SaveChanges();
```

## Installing VenturaSQL Studio
[Download](https://dotnet.sysdev.nl/venturasql) and run the VenturaSQL Studio installer. The installer comes with ready to run template projects.

**or**

Download this GitHub repository and open the solution and run the VenturaSQLStudio project. This GitHub repository does not include the template projects.
You can download the templates from the [Templates-VenturaSQLStudio](https://github.com/frankthvandeven/Templates-VenturaSQLStudio) repository.

## See it run on your PC in minutes
The easiest way to get started with VenturaSQL is to run the installer, create a new project with the Blazor WebAssembly template and run it. Open the [Getting started with VenturaSQL](https://sysdev.nl/getting-started-with-venturasql/) article for illustrated instructions.

## Advanced Features
+ In desktop apps, a recordset can also connect to a database directly.
+ A recordset can hold multiple resultsets.
+ Updating multiple tables using multiple recordsets can easily be bundled into a single database transaction (for rollback) using the Transactional.SaveChanges() method.
+ Calculated columns.
+ Column properties (optionally) generate the data binding events INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged.
+ VenturaSQL Studio has a code snippet generator, for example for filling viewmodels.
